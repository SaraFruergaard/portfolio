                            <h1>Team-Process</h1>
                            <p>We were a team of 5 and had a time span of four weeks to finish the project. 
                                Based on the briefe we were given we directly decided on building for TikTok becuse that is a highly used app within the target audience.
                                The reson we chose to not do anything in VR or MR is becuse headsets are not as accessible as phones. Our ide was to have somthing simpe and fun but also a bit creepy to match the vibe of the movie.
                                We wanted somthing that had a hight posebility of going viral so peopel would conect it to the movie.</p>

                                <p>We decided on making two diffrent fillters based on our reserch and tester feedback. The first one witch is a very trendy and goofy thing perfect for making fuss about the movie.
                                    And the second one witch is more impressive and alowe us to struggel in the developing procces. Both of them is easy and accessible for everyone with TikTok.  </p>

                                        <li><span>Process</span><br>The head filter is a 3D scan of prop from the movie that later was put into blender to make it a 3D Model. Later on transferd to Effect House with materials.
                                        The head is not atatched to anything so you can freely move it around on the screen with your finger. </br></li>
                                        <li><span>Purpose</span><br>Made based on a Tiktok trend in intentions to go viral witch would lead to people talking about the upcoming movie. 
                                            The trend is basecly filming a video of aan object with movments matching that specific song. 
                                            The most viwed one in this trend is on a bowl of strawberrys coverd in meted chocklate, and it has 120 milion viwes.</br></li>

                                        All the assets are made in eighter blender or maya. The door can get moved with help of the finger but it is placed so it's fixed above the floor.
                                        The door open by a tap on it and thats also when the sounds and animation start. after that you can freely walk around in the house. </br></li>
                                        <li><span>Purpose</span><br>This filter is a recreation of a house in the movie. It is very old, creepy and hounted so that is the vibe we were trying to recreate.
                                        It is a very easy filter to use witch is perfect for the target audience who usally have a lower attention span. </br></li>
